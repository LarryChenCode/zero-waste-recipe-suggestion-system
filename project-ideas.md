## Project Ideas
* Providing suggested recipes' likelihood of belonging to a certain cusines. To do this we need a data set where each recipe cleanly associated to a cusine.
* We can try to create a random pantry data set and using this data set we can suggest daily recipes to optimize the total shelf-life of our pantry for the next day. We can try to handle this by a feedback loop powered with neural nets.
* One modelling problem could be for a given recipe estimate how much time it will take.
